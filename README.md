## The Story

I met a woman at the ATM stand and she was complaining that of how complex Facebook Business Suite is and that she needed a simple way to present her business online. She went further to tell me about how she lost jobs because she didn't have an online presence for her "small brand". I asked her what kind of platform would you like to use. She said something simple, she just wanted to present her business, what it is about and dispay few of her recent projects. I went further to ask my peers who were into online business and some other business people and they complained that the existing services require a lot of verification and upload and you can't just reuse a link from your cloud storage or somewhere. After thinking about all these, I decided to come up with an idea of a web application that can solve their problem. With simplicity in mind, I embarked on this project. Thus, Vitrine was born.

I used a Kanban board on Trello to keep track of tasks in order to be able to stick to a plan. Gradually, I completed the checklist on each card and moved them to the next list.

## Getting Started

<!-- You can easily access it from our website: https://vitrine.me -->

- ### Launch the API first

  1. Setup database

  ```bash
  mysql -uroot -p < setup_mysql_dev.sql
  ```

  2. **[Optional]** Seed db with dummy data

  ```bash
  VIT_ENV=dev VIT_MYSQL_USER=vit_dev VIT_MYSQL_PWD=vit_dev_pwd VIT_MYSQL_DB=vit_db VIT_MYSQL_HOST=localhost python3 feed_db.py
  ```

  3. Start the API

  ```
  VIT_ENV=dev VIT_MYSQL_USER=vit_dev VIT_MYSQL_PWD=vit_dev_pwd VIT_MYSQL_DB=vit_db VIT_MYSQL_HOST=localhost VIT_API_HOST=0.0.0.0 VIT_API_PORT=5001 VIT_MAIL_SENDER=<email> VIT_MAIL_PASSWORD=<mail_password> python3 -m api.v1.app
  ```

- ### Launch the web app

  _Optional: VIT_API_URL_

  ```
  VIT_ENV=dev VIT_MYSQL_USER=vit_dev VIT_MYSQL_PWD=vit_dev_pwd VIT_MYSQL_DB=vit_db VIT_MYSQL_HOST=localhost python3 -m web.app
  ```

## Testing

This project is tested with the unittest module.

1. Ensure that the API and the web app are properly configured and running for test:
